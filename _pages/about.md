<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year PhD student at National Taiwan University, in the Speech Processing and Machine Learning Lab. 
My research interests include speech self-supervised models, model compression, and neuron analysis. 
I am eager to explore new research areas and am currently looking for research internships for the year 2025. 
If there are any possibilities for research collaboration, please feel free to contact me.

[MelHuBERT: A Simplified Hubert on Mel Spectrograms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10389700)

**Tzu-Quan Lin**, Hung-yi Lee, Hao Tang

[**Project**](https://github.com/nervjack2/MelHuBERT)
- MelHuBERT simplifies the model architecture and loss function of HuBERT, achieving comparable performance while saving 33.5% of MACs per one second of speech.

[Compressing Transformer-based self-supervised models for speech processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09949)

**Tzu-Quan Lin**, Tsung-Huan Yang, Chun-Yao Chang, Kuang-Ming Chen, Tzu-hsun Feng, Hung-yi Lee, Hao Tang

[**Project**](https://github.com/nervjack2/Speech-SSL-Compression/)
- This work propose evaluating model compression methods using three different metrics: MACs, number of parameters, and real-time factor. We find that different compression methods excel in different metrics.
